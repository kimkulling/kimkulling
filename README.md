Hi there, I am Kim Kulling!

I am a professional Software-Architect and Project-Lead in my day job. I live with my girlfriend and two children in Luebeck, a city at the baltic see.

During my free time I am working on the Asset-Importer-Lib as the Lead Developer. When you have any questions related to the Asset Importer Lib or need some guidance feel free to contact me. You can find our Asset-Importer-Lib repo here: https://github.com/assimp/assimp

I am also a big fan of real-time-rendering. You can find my experiments here: https://github.com/kimkulling/osre
